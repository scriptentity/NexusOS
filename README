NexusOS is an open source Unix-based operating system that allows users to view all running code and processes graphically. It also permits the installation of custom frameworks which permits users to modify the operating system extensively. This project is currently in alpha and is scheduled to be long term, probably taking several years. NexusOS is at the moment very far from completion and will over the next few years see the addition of files in any order. It will only run correctly (or at all) when the first beta is released, which will not be for at least another 4 years. As of yet NexusOS is not ready for public testing, however if you wish you may follow the below instructions to compile parts of the code. Do not expect any significant end results. At the moment, NexusOS is only supported for compile and run on Linux, and even there is not ready for use. 

How to use (Linux):
- dd if=/dev/zero of=xdiskimage bs=32 skip=1 count=9375000000 conv=sync
- fdisk xdiskimage
- in the menu, enter <x>, then enter <c>
- for the number of cylinders, enter <1048576>
- use the default value for the first and last cylinders
- in the menu, enter <r>, then enter <w>
- mkfs.ext4 xdiskimage
- enter <y> in response to the warning

You have now created the mountable filesystem which will temporarily contain the NexusOS operating system. Though at the moment this is not required, you can mount it using:
- mount -t ext4 -o loop,rw,auto,users,exec xdiskimage /mnt
